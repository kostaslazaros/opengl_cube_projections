This paper presents the implementation of a simple unit cube which can be interactively rotated around the x, y and z axes as well as the implementation of three different projections of the cube on the xy plane. Those projections are the following:

1) Perspective projection

2) Cavalier projection

3) Cabinet projection

The code was developed in C++ using functions from the OpenGl graphics library.

The first chapter is a brief analysis of the source code implemented for drawing the unit cube and making it interactive.

The second chapter describes the implementation of the cavalier oblique projection.


The third chapter describes the implementation of the cabinet oblique projection.

Finally conlcusions are drawn and the sources used to implement the project are provided.
